# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project repository. This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to derive meaningful insights and trends. The Jupyter notebook containing the complete work can be found in the [notebooks](./notebooks/) folder.

## Project Overview

Utilised the healthcare dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating competence in KDD software tools. Implemented data cleaning strategies, including the removal of features with â‰¥ 60% missing data, and applied supervised learning techniques (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) for health condition classification. Emphasized model validation and evaluation, discussing precision and recall performance. Additionally, employed unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to explore patterns in health status categories, showcasing a holistic approach to data analysis and interpretation.
